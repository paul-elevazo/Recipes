*Adapted from: [The Cooking Guy](https://www.thecookingguy.com/recipes/osso-buco-beef-shanks-w-roasted-garlic-mascarpone-polenta)*

## Ingredients

- 4 (2 inch) beef shanks
- Kosher salt & fresh ground pepper
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- Olive oil
- 1 small yellow onion, diced small
- 2 carrots, diced small
- 1 stick celery, diced small
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1½ cups beef stock (reduced from original)
- 1½ cups dark ale or porter beer (reduced from original)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 thyme sprigs
- 1/3 cup chopped curly parsley

## Instructions

1. Using kitchen twine, tie the shanks around their equator to keep them from coming apart when they become super tender
2. Season them with salt & pepper, then dust well with flour
3. Heat a couple tablespoons of oil in a large skillet and brown beef 3-4 minutes each side until beautifully browned – remove to slow cooker
4. Add a little more oil to the same skillet, then put in the onion, carrot and celery - cook 5 minutes or until softened and browned slightly
5. Add garlic, cook for 30 seconds, then add tomato paste, stirring well to incorporate
6. Add the stock, beer, soy sauce, and thyme – mix well and bring to a simmer
7. Pour the vegetable and liquid mixture over the beef shanks in the slow cooker
8. Cover and cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or HIGH for 4-5 hours, until beef is fork-tender and falling off the bone
9. Stir in chopped parsley during the last 30 minutes of cooking

## Cook Time
- Prep: 20 minutes
- Cook: 6-8 hours (LOW) or 4-5 hours (HIGH)
- Total: 6½-8½ hours

## Serves
4 people

## Notes
- Browning the meat first is crucial for developing deep flavor
- Reduced liquid amounts since slow cookers don't allow evaporation like oven braising
- Don't lift the lid during cooking - this releases heat and extends cooking time
- Perfect served over mashed potatoes, polenta, pasta, or creamy risotto
- Can be made ahead and reheated - flavors improve overnight

## Slow Cooker Tips
- For best results, use a 6-quart slow cooker
- If sauce seems too thin at the end, remove shanks and simmer liquid in a saucepan to reduce
- For richer flavor, deglaze the browning pan with a splash of wine before adding to slow cooker
